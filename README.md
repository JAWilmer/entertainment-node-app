## ABOUT LIRI ##

This entertainment-node-app is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface, or LIRI for short.  LIRI's main function is to take specific parameters for simple entertainment-related search requests and return relevant results.  Feed LIRI a movie title, band/ artist name, song title, or Tweet request and she will provide you with more details regarding these queries.  LIRI also keeps a log of results from her searches.

__Functionality:__ LIRI is coded with Javascript and uses Node packages to work her magic.  She provides her search results by API calls to Bands in Town, Spotify, OMDB, and Twitter.

__How to use LIRI:__ Enter any of these request in LIRI's terminal:
* concert-this 'artist/band name'
* spotify-this-song 'song title'
* movie-this 'movie title'
* my-tweets  (this returns a list of Julieâ€™s tweets)
