This entertainment-node-app is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface, or LIRI for short.  LIRI's main function is to take specific parameters for simple entertainment-related search requests and return relevant results.  Feed LIRI a movie title, band/ artist name, song title, or Tweet request and she will provide you with more details regarding these queries.  LIRI will also keep a log of results from her searches.

__Functionality:__ LIRI is coded with Javascript and uses Node packages to work her magic.  She provides her search results by API calls to Bands in Town, Spotify, OMDB, and Twitter.

__How to use LIRI: Enter any of these request in LIRI's terminal:
>*concert-this 'artist/band name'
>*spotify-this-song 'song title'
>*movie-this 'movie title'
>*my-tweets  (this returns a list of Julieâ€™s tweets)

__What did LIRI do?__
As she works, LIRI creates a log file then appends her search results within the log.  In the image below, notice that LIRI has not yet created a log.
